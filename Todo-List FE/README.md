- **Responsive design** that works on all devices
- **Real-time updates** with database synchronization

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js v19.1.0
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Styling**: Bootstrap 5.3.6
- **HTTP Client**: Axios

## üì¶ Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher) or yarn
- MongoDB Atlas account or local MongoDB installation

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd Todo-List BE
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the backend root directory with your MongoDB connection string:
   ```
   MONGO_API_KEY=your_mongodb_connection_string
   PORT=5000
   ```
4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd Todo-List FE
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. The application will automatically open in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## üß™ Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
